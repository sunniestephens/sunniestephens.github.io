<h2 style="text-align:center">Frederick Freeman</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
    Is it the wind that stirs the trees,<br/>
    Is it the trees that scratch the wall,<br/>
    Is it the wall that shakes and mutters,<br/>
    Is it a dumb ghost's call?</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
    The wind steals in and twirls the candle,<br/>
    The branches heave and brush the wall,<br/>
    But more than tree or wild wind mutters<br/>
    This night, this night of all.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
    "Open!" a cry sounds, and I gasp.<br/>
    "Open!" and hands beat door and wall.<br/>
    "Open!" and each dark echo mutters.<br/>
    I rise, a shape and shadow tall.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
    "Open!" Across the room I falter,<br/>
    And near the door crouch by the wall;<br/>
    Thrice bolt the door as the voice mutters<br/>
    "Open!" and frail strokes fall.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
    "Open!" The light's out, and I shrink<br/>
    Quaking and blind against the wall;<br/>
    "Open!" no sound is, yet it mutters<br/>
    Within me now, this night of all.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
    Was it the wind that stirred the trees,<br/>
    Was it the trees that scratched the wall,<br/>
    Was it the wall that shook and muttered.<br/>
    Or Love's last, ghostly call?</p>
